# backlog.md — Master Index of Unfinished Work

> This file is the **master index of all unfinished / handed-off work.**
> Every worker and sub-agent writes unfinished work as a detailed report in `backlog/<task-name>.md`
> and adds a single-line entry here. **Goal: never lose track of any task.**
> All entries and reports are written in **English**.
>
> Index row format:
> `| Date | Task | Worker/Agent | Status | Report | Priority |`

## Open Tasks

| Date | Task | Worker/Agent | Status | Report | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-19 | Modifier-gesture hardening: VoiceOver on/off toggle (needs a settings surface) + `NSWorkspace` sleep/lock force-stop | opencode worker | open | `backlog/2026-09-19-modifier-only-and-horizontal-expand.md` | P2 |
## Round-2 Reports (2026-09-19)
> Index of the round-2 worker reports. PRs #10 (`a8c4416`), #9 (`259dbe9`) and #11 (`a01d6a1`)
> merged 2026-09-19, so `backlog/guard-rules-schedule.md`, `backlog/keeper.md` and
> `backlog/anchor-sep6.md` are already on `main`; `backlog/rule-types-docs.md` lands with PR #8
> (independent, awaiting Owner A review). The rescued #5/#6 reports land with this docs PR.
> See `backlog/2026-09-19-closed-prs-and-round2-plan.md`.

## Completed Tasks (Archive)

| Date | Task | Worker/Agent | Closed By | Report |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-19 | Monorepo skeleton: `interfaces/`, `agent/`, `app/` (Tauri v2 + React), `stellar/`, `contracts/` (Soroban), tooling (`Makefile`, `scripts/`, `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`) | coordinating agent (no workers, per user instruction) | [PR #4](https://github.com/n0tnow/StellarVoiceControlProject/pull/4) (merged 2026-09-19T12:01:56Z, commit `a559403`) | `backlog/2026-09-19-monorepo-skeleton.md` |
| 2026-09-19 | **A0 — push-to-talk + notch overlay**: global `control+option+space` hotkey, `cpal`→WAV capture, AppKit notch overlay driven by the event stream; `dev_self_test` deleted | opencode worker (deepseek-v4.1-flash) | pending PR review (branch `feat/a0-push-to-talk-notch`) | `backlog/2026-09-19-a0-push-to-talk-notch.md` |
| 2026-09-19 | **Notch shape fix**: idle pill matches the measured cutout (179x32, was 199x36), four derived corner radii flow through the `NotchGeometry` seam, geometry-driven silhouette | opencode worker (deepseek-v4.1-flash) | pending user visual check (branch `feat/a0-push-to-talk-notch`) | `backlog/2026-09-19-notch-shape-fix.md` |
