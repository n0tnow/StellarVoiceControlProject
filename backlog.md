# backlog.md — Master Index of Unfinished Work

> This file is the **master index of all unfinished / handed-off work.**
> Every worker and sub-agent writes unfinished work as a detailed report in `backlog/<task-name>.md`
> and adds a single-line entry here. **Goal: never lose track of any task.**
> All entries and reports are written in **English**.
>
> Index row format:
> `| Date | Task | Worker/Agent | Status | Report | Priority |`
